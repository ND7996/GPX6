LOGICALLY CONNECTED TREE - EXPLANATION
================================================================

PROBLEM:
In your original merged tree, GPX6 sequences were placed in a 
SEPARATE BRANCH from all mammals. This didn't reflect the 
logical relationship where:
- Human_WT should be close to Homo_sapiens
- Mouse_WT should be close to Mus_musculus

SOLUTION:
We inserted the GPX6 sequences INTO the mammalian tree at the 
appropriate branches:

1. HUMAN LINEAGE:
   Original: (Pan_troglodytes, Homo_sapiens)30
   Modified: (Pan_troglodytes, (Homo_sapiens, Human_GPX6_clade)200)30
   
   Human_GPX6_clade contains:
   - Human_WT (lab version of human GPX6)
   - All H2M mutation levels (evolved toward mouse-like)

2. MOUSE LINEAGE:
   Original: (Mus_musculus, Rattus_norvegicus)37
   Modified: ((Mus_musculus, Mouse_GPX6_clade)201, Rattus_norvegicus)37
   
   Mouse_GPX6_clade contains:
   - Mouse_WT (lab version of mouse GPX6)
   - All M2H mutation levels (evolved toward human-like)

3. ANCESTOR:
   Ancestor_node25 is placed as an outgroup to root the tree.

WHY THIS IS BETTER:
- Phylogenetic relationships match logical relationships
- Mouse_WT is now sister to Mus_musculus (as it should be)
- Human_WT is now sister to Homo_sapiens (as it should be)
- The tree structure reflects the TRUE biological relationships

HOW TO USE:
1. Open LOGICALLY_CONNECTED_TREE_FIXED.nwk in FigTree
2. Compare with your original tree
3. Note how GPX6 sequences are now nested within mammalian branches

================================================================
Node Number Summary:
- Mammalian tree: nodes 23-43
- Human GPX6 clade: nodes 100-162 (original + 100 offset)
- Mouse GPX6 clade: nodes 100-142 (original + 100 offset)
- New connection nodes: 200 (human), 201 (mouse)
- Root: node 202
- Ancestor: renumbered to avoid conflicts
