NODE MAPPING AND LOGICAL CONNECTIONS
============================================================

MAMMALIAN TREE (Natural Evolution)
----------------------------------------
Root: node 23
Species: 23 mammalian species
Key species:
  - Homo_sapiens (human): in clade with node 30
  - Mus_musculus (mouse): in clade with node 37
  - Pan_troglodytes (chimpanzee): in clade with node 30
  - Rattus_norvegicus (rat): in clade with node 37

GPX6 EXPERIMENTAL TREE (Renumbered)
----------------------------------------
Original root: node 63
Renumbered root: node 104 (63 + 41 offset)
Sequences: 44 total (1 ancestor + 2 WT + 41 mutations)
Key sequences:
  - Ancestor_node25: Hypothetical ancestral protein
  - Mouse_WT: Experimental mouse GPX6 (node 83 = 42+41)
  - Human_WT: Experimental human GPX6 (node 103 = 62+41)
  - M2H mutations: Evolved FROM Mouse_WT toward human-like
  - H2M mutations: Evolved FROM Human_WT toward mouse-like

LOGICAL CONNECTIONS
----------------------------------------
These are CONCEPTUAL connections, not direct tree connections:

  Homo_sapiens (natural)  ↔  Human_WT (experimental)
  (Node 30 in mammal tree)   (Node 103 in GPX6 tree)
  ↓                          ↓
  Natural human protein      Lab version of human protein

  Mus_musculus (natural)   ↔  Mouse_WT (experimental)
  (Node 37 in mammal tree)   (Node 83 in GPX6 tree)
  ↓                          ↓
  Natural mouse protein      Lab version of mouse protein

EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION PATHS:
  1. M2H path: Mouse_WT → ... → More human-like mutations
  2. H2M path: Human_WT → ... → More mouse-like mutations
  3. Both paths show evolutionary hysteresis

HOW TO INTERPRET THE MERGED TREE
----------------------------------------
1. The tree has TWO independent evolutionary stories:
   - Left branch: Natural evolution (millions of years)
   - Right branch: Experimental evolution (lab mutations)

2. The connection is LOGICAL, not topological:
   - Mouse_WT is the lab equivalent of Mus_musculus protein
   - Human_WT is the lab equivalent of Homo_sapiens protein

3. In phylogenetic terms:
   - This is a tree of 67 sequences
   - 23 are natural species proteins
   - 44 are experimental/variant proteins
   - They share a common root but evolved differently
