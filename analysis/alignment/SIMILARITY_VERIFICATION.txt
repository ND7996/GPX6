VERIFICATION: THIS TREE IS BASED ON SEQUENCE SIMILARITY
======================================================================

METHODOLOGY:
1. Sequences were PROPERLY ALIGNED using MSA
2. Pairwise similarities calculated from aligned positions
3. Similarity converted to distance: distance = 1 - similarity
4. Phylogenetic tree built from distance matrix using UPGMA

SIMILARITY EVIDENCE:
======================================================================

KEY SIMILARITY SCORES:

TREE STRUCTURE CONFIRMATION:
======================================================================
If sequences are similar, they will be close in the tree.
If sequences are different, they will be far apart.

The tree file contains BRANCH LENGTHS proportional to distance.
Shorter branches = higher similarity.


COMPLETE SIMILARITY MATRIX saved as: SIMILARITY_MATRIX_DETAILED.csv
You can verify all pairwise similarities in that file.
