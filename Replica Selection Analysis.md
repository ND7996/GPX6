Replica Selection Analysis
This readme contains code and data to perform a structured analysis on replica selection, including saving relevant data in LaTeX tables, filtering outliers, and visualizing filtered data through scatter plots. The analysis focuses on key metrics (dg* and dg0) for evaluating replica performance.


Replica Selection

Save dg* and dg0 in separate LaTeX tables. 
Detect and remove outliers and NaN values from all files.
Create scatter plots of the filtered values.
