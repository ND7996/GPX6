\section{Results and Discussion}

Our comprehensive study on the wild type and variants demonstrate the evolution of glutathione peroxidase protein 6 cys and selenium protein. 
Despite the difference in the cysteine and selenocysteine parameters in the system, they show a wide range of associated evolutionary pathway.
We first optimised the reaction one of stepwise mechanism in going from selenol to selenolate of selenocysteine and thiol to thiolate ion in case of cysteine while setting up the Empirical Valence Bond Simulation.
The substrate hydrogen peroxide was placed at the distance from selenocystiene/cysteine and glutamine83 as mentioned in the qm/mm calculations by morokuma (\cite).
