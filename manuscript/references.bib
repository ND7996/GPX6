	abstract = {Selenocysteine (Sec), the 21st amino acid, exists naturally in all kingdoms of life as the defining entity of selenoproteins. Sec is a cysteine (Cys) residue analogue with a selenium-containing selenol group in place of the sulfur-containing thiol group in Cys. The selenium atom gives Sec quite different properties from Cys. The most obvious difference is the lower pKa of Sec, and Sec is also a stronger nucleophile than Cys. Proteins naturally containing Sec are often enzymes, employing the reactivity of the Sec residue during the catalytic cycle and therefore Sec is normally essential for their catalytic efficiencies. Other unique features of Sec, not shared by any of the other 20 common amino acids, derive from the atomic weight and chemical properties of selenium and the particular occurrence and properties of its stable and radioactive isotopes. Sec is, moreover, incorporated into proteins by an expansion of the genetic code as the translation of selenoproteins involves the decoding of a UGA codon, otherwise being a termination codon. In this review, we will describe the different unique properties of Sec and we will discuss the prerequisites for selenoprotein production as well as the possible use of Sec introduction into proteins for biotechnological applications. These include residue-specific radiolabeling with gamma or positron emitters, the use of Sec as a reactive handle for electophilic probes introducing fluorescence or other peptide conjugates, as the basis for affinity purification of recombinant proteins, the trapping of folding intermediates, improved phasing in X-ray crystallography, introduction of 77Se for NMR spectroscopy, or, finally, the analysis or tailoring of enzymatic reactions involving thiol or oxidoreductase (redox) selenolate chemistry.},

Protein-protein interfaces can be seen as stable, organized regions where residues from different partners form non-covalent interactions that are responsible for interaction specificity and strength. They are commonly described as a peripheral region, whose role is to protect the core region that concentrates the most contributing interactions, from the solvent. To get insights into the dynamics of protein-protein complexes, we carried out all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent on eight different protein-protein complexes of different functional class and interface size by taking into account the bound and unbound forms. On the one hand, we characterized structural changes upon binding of the proteins, and on the other hand we extensively analyzed the interfaces and the structural waters involved in the binding. Based on our analysis, in 6 cases out of 8, the interfaces rearranged during the simulation time, in stable and long-lived substates with alternative residue-residue contacts. These rearrangements are not restricted to side-chain fluctuations in the periphery but also affect the core interface. Finally, the analysis of the waters at the interface and involved in the binding pointed out the importance to take into account their role in the estimation of the interaction strength.},

Taking intő account that the redox processes are nőt spontaneous in cells, bút the adequate reaction velocity and appropriate specificity are achieved by the catalyzing activity of enzymes, special attention has raised toward the glutathioneutilizing enzymes. Glutathione reductase (GR) is a NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase which catalyzes the conversion of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH). Somé members of the diverse glutathione transferase (GST) enzyme family have GSH-dependent thiol transferase activity and participate in the recycling of antioxidants (ascorbate, flavonoids, quinones), while other isoenzymes, due to their 5-transferase activity, are involved in the detoxification mechanisms using GSH as co-substrate. A significant portion of GST isoenzymes alsó has glutathione peroxidase activity and can convert lipid peroxides and other peroxides to less harmful compounds. The plánt glutathione peroxidase enzymes (GPXs) may be involved in the detoxification of H20 2 and organic hydroperoxides and in the reguládon of the cellular redox homeostasis by maintaining the thiol/disulfide balance. Most of plánt GPXs prefer to use thioredoxin (TRX) instead of glutathione as a reducing agent, and it is thought that the GPXs may represent a link between the glutathione- and the thioredoxin-based system. The GR, GPX and somé GST isoenzymes have Cys in their active center and thus are directly regulated by redox status. This chapter summarizes their roles in stress responses as antioxidant enzymes, in determining the redox status of cells, and emphasizes their connection to redox signaling mechanisms.},

They adopted diverse functions ranging from detoxiﬁcation of H2O2 to redox signaling and differentiation. The relative stability of the selenoenzymes, however, remained enigmatic in view of the postulated involvement of a highly unstable selenenic acid form during catalysis. Nevertheless, density functional theory calculations obtained with a representative active site model verify the mechanistic concept of GPx catalysis and underscore its efﬁciency. However, they also allow that the selenenic acid, in the absence of the reducing substrate, reacts with a nitrogen in the active site. MS/MS analysis of oxidized rat GPx4 complies with the predicted structure, an 8-membered ring, in which selenium is bound as selenenylamide to the protein backbone. The intermediate can be re-integrated into the canonical GPx cycle by glutathione, whereas, under denaturing conditions, its selenium moiety undergoes β-cleavage with formation of a dehydro-alanine residue. The selenenylamide bypass prevents destruction of the redox center due to over-oxidation of the selenium or its elimination and likely allows ﬁne-tuning of GPx activity or alternate substrate reactions for regulatory purposes.},

We present new algorithms that allow pKa shifts due to inductive (i.e., covalently coupled) intraligand interactions, as well as noncovalently coupled interligand interactions in multiligand complexes, to be included in the prediction. The number of different ligand chemical groups that are automatically recognized has been increased to 18, and the general implementation has been changed so that new functional groups can be added easily by the user, aided by a new and more general protonation scheme. Except for a few cases, the new algorithms in PROPKA3.1 are found to yield results similar to or better than those obtained with PROPKA2.0 (Bas et al. Proteins: Struct., Funct., Bioinf.2008, 73, 765-783). Finally, we present a novel algorithm that identifies noncovalently coupled ionizable groups, where pK a prediction may be especially difficult.

   abstract = {A consistent simulation of ionic or strongly polar solutes in polar solvents presents a major challenge from both fundamental and practical aspects. The frequently used method of periodic boundary conditions (PBC) does not correctly take into account the symmetry of the solute field. Instead of using PBC, it is natural to model this type of system as a sphere (with the solute at the origin), but the boundary conditions to be used in such a model are not obvious. Early calculations performed with our surface constrained soft sphere dipoles (SCSSD) model indicated that the dipoles near the surface of the sphere will show unusual orientational preferences (they will overpolarize) unless a corrective force is included in the model, and thus we implemented polarization constraints in this spherical model of polar solutions. More recent approaches that treated the surface with stochastic dynamics, but did not take into account the surface polarization effects, were also found to exhibit these nonphysical orientational preferences. The present work develops a surface constrained all-atom solvent (SCAAS) model in order to consistently treat the surface polarization effects in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The SCAAS model, which was presented in a preliminary way in previous works, introduces surface constraints as boundary conditions in order to make the necessarily finite system behave as if it was part of an infinite system. The performance of the model with regard to various properties of bulk water is examined by comparing its results to those obtained by PBC simulations. The results obtained from SCAAS models of different sizes are found to be similar to each other and to the corresponding PBC results. The performance of the model in simulations of solvated ions is emphasized and a comparison of the results obtained with spheres of different sizes demonstrates that the model does not possess significant size dependence. This indicates that the model can be used with a relatively small number of solvent molecules for convergent simulation of structure, energetics, and dynamics of polar solutions. The much simpler fixed center Langevin dipoles (FCLD) model is also examined and found to provide a powerful tool for estimating solvation free energies. Finally, a preliminary study of the dielectric properties of the SCAAS model is reported and the potential of this model for exploring the correct implementation of the solvent reaction field is discussed. © 1989 American Institute of Physics.},

EVB is a fast and reliable method that allows one to determine the reaction free-energy profiles in complex systems, such as enzymes, by employing classical force fields to represent a chemical reaction. Therefore, running EVB simulations is basically as fast as any classical molecular dynamics simulation, and the method uses standard free-energy calculations to map the free-energy change along a given reaction path. To exemplify and validate our EVB implementation, we replicated two cases of our earlier enzyme simulations. One of these addresses the decomposition of the activation free energy into its enthalpic and entropic components, and the other is focused on calculating the overall catalytic effect of the enzyme compared to the same reaction in water. These two examples give virtually identical results to those obtained with programs that were specifically designed for EVB simulations and show that the GROMACS implementation is robust and can be used for very large systems.}

Sec is analogous to the common cysteine (Cys) amino acid but its selenium atom offers physical-chemical properties not provided by the corresponding sulfur atom in Cys. Catalytic sites with Sec in selenoproteins of vertebrates are under strong purifying selection but one enzyme, Glutathione Peroxidase 6 (GPX6), independently exchanged Sec for Cys less than one hundred million years ago in several mammalian lineages. We reconstructed and assayed these ancient enzymes before and after Sec was lost and up to today, and found them to have lost their classic ability to reduce hydroperoxides using glutathione (GSH). This loss of function, however, was accompanied by additional amino acid changes in the catalytic domain, with protein sites concertedly changing under positive selection across distant lineages abandoning Sec in GPX6. This demonstrates a narrow evolutionary range in maintaining fitness when sulfur in Cys impairs the catalytic activity of this protein, with pleiotropy and epistasis likely driving the observed convergent evolution. We propose that the mutations shared across distinct lineages may trigger enzymatic properties beyond those in classic GPXs, rather than simply recovering catalytic rate. These findings are an unusual example of adaptive convergence across mammalian selenoproteins, with the evolutionary signatures possibly representing the evolution of novel oxidoreductase functions.}

Recent studies have used new strategies to explore the prevalence, biochemical mechanisms, and evolutionary implications of these interactions—called epistasis—within proteins. Here we describe an emerging picture of pervasive epistasis in which the physical and biological effects of mutations change over the course of evolution in a lineage-specific fashion. Epistasis can restrict the trajectories available to an evolving protein or open new paths to sequences and functions that would otherwise have been inaccessible. We describe two broad classes of epistatic interactions, which arise from different physical mechanisms and have different effects on evolutionary processes. Specific epistasis—in which one mutation influences the phenotypic effect of few other mutations—is caused by direct and indirect physical interactions between mutations, which nonadditively change the protein's physical properties, such as conformation, stability, or affinity for ligands. In contrast, nonspecific epistasis describes mutations that modify the effect of many others; these typically behave additively with respect to the physical properties of a protein but exhibit epistasis because of a nonlinear relationship between the physical properties and their biological effects, such as function or fitness. Both types of interaction are rampant, but specific epistasis has stronger effects on the rate and outcomes of evolution, because it imposes stricter constraints and modulates evolutionary potential more dramatically; it therefore makes evolution more contingent on low-probability historical events and leaves stronger marks on the sequences, structures, and functions of protein families.}

The relative stability of the selenoenzymes, however, remained enigmatic in view of the postulated involvement of a highly unstable selenenic acid form during catalysis. Nevertheless, density functional theory calculations obtained with a representative active site model verify the mechanistic concept of GPx catalysis and underscore its efficiency. However, they also allow that the selenenic acid, in the absence of the reducing substrate, reacts with a nitrogen in the active site. MS/MS analysis of oxidized rat GPx4 complies with the predicted structure, an 8-membered ring, in which selenium is bound as selenenylamide to the protein backbone. The intermediate can be re-integrated into the canonical GPx cycle by glutathione, whereas, under denaturing conditions, its selenium moiety undergoes β-cleavage with formation of a dehydro-alanine residue. The selenenylamide bypass prevents destruction of the redox center due to over-oxidation of the selenium or its elimination and likely allows fine-tuning of GPx activity or alternate substrate reactions for regulatory purposes.}

   abstract = {The cysteine and selenocysteine oxidation by H2O2 in vacuo and in aqueous solution was studied using the integrated molecular orbital + molecular orbital (IMOMO) method combining the quadratic configuration method QCISD(T) and the spin projection of second-order perturbation theory PMP2. It is shown that including in the model system of cysteine (selenocysteine) residue up to 20 atoms has significant consequences upon the calculated reaction energy barrier. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that free cysteine and selenocysteine have very similar reaction energy barriers, 77-79 kJ mol -1 in aqueous solution. It is thus concluded that the high experimental reaction rate constant reported for the oxidation of the selenocysteine residue in the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) active center is due to an important interaction between selenocysteine and its molecular environment. The sensitivity of the calculated energy barrier to the dielectric constant of the molecular environment observed for both cysteine and selenocysteine as well as the catalytic effect of the NH group emphasized in the case of cysteine supports this hypothesis. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {In this ONIOM(QM:MM) study, we evaluate the role of the protein surroundings in the mechanism of H2O2 reduction catalyzed by the glutathione peroxidase enzyme, using the whole monomer (3113 atoms in 196 amino acid residues) as a model. A new optimization scheme that allows the full optimization of transition states for large systems has been utilized. It was found that in the presence of the surrounding protein the optimized active site structure bears a closer resemblance to the one in the X-ray structure than that without the surrounding protein. H2O2 reduction occurs through a two-step mechanism. In the first step, the selenolate anion (E-Se-) formation occurs with a barrier of 16.4 kcal/mol and is endothermic by 12.0 kcal/mol. The Gln83 residue plays the key role of the proton abstractor, which is in line with the experimental suggestion. In the second step, the O-O bond is cleaved, and selenenic acid (R-Se-OH) and a water molecule are formed. The calculated barrier for this process is 6.0 kcal/mol, and it is exothermic by 80.9 kcal/mol. The overall barrier of 18.0 kcal/mol for H2O2 reduction is in reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured barrier of 14.9 kcal/mol. The protein surroundings has been calculated to exert a net effect of only 0.70 kcal/mol (in comparison to the "active site only" model including solvent effects) on the overall barrier, which is most likely due to the active site being located at the enzyme surface. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},
